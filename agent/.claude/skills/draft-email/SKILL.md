# /draft-email

Draft an email based on my writing style and knowledge.

## Steps

1. Read `memory/me.md` for writing tone, style, and preferences
2. Check `memory/_index.md` for relevant context (e.g., if emailing a known contact, read their memory file; if about a product, read the product memory)
3. If you need more detail than the memory provides, follow links to the full documents in `knowledge/`
4. Draft the email matching my style
5. Save to `output/YYYY-MM-DD-email-<brief-description>.md`
6. Show a brief summary in chat and the file path
